~Tindify~
Music finding app using Spotify that plays the sample of
the suggested music in a "card-like" format (think Tinder cards)
and loops the sample while user remains at card before swipe occurs.
If user swipes right, song is added to a list of songs that users likes.
If user swipes left, song is ignored and search is used to filter upcoming songs.
Possibly integrate with "rate your music" (and other similar sites) that could 
grab songs from top artists/albums and play the sample allowing you to determine
your interest in that area.
There could be a history in case a user accidentally swipes wrong way or misses
a song and wants to "course correct" their listening patterns.
